# wgplugin/dwd

You need a free FTP account from www.dwd.de to use this plugin. 

* dwd\_cron.pl - Put this file to your home directory, and add it to your users crontab. It will create a HTML file for visu integration and send current warnings via UDP for further processing.
* DWD - This is the WG plugin that will process the received warnings (will be included later)
* dwd\_warnings.css - This file provides the styling for the HTML file. It works with my custom CometVisu design, which is based on the "metal" design.
